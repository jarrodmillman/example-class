By default logs will be written to `grade.log`.
It is useful to break the log into discrete units of work.
Rename and commit the log of that unit something like:

    2014-07-14-push-classwork.log
    2014-07-14-score-hw2.log 
    2014-07-16-pull-tag-hw5.log
    2014-07-16-push-classwork.log
    2014-07-16-score-hw3-update.log
